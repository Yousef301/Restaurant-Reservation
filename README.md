## **Requirements**:

1. Create a DB named **`RestaurantReservationCore`** (using SSMS).
2. Create a console application project named **`RestaurantReservation`**.
3. Create a library project named **`RestaurantReservation.Db`** and reference it from **`RestaurantReservation`** project. 
4. Create `**RestaurantReservationDbContext**` and add it to `**RestaurantReservation.Db**`.
5. Create the data models for the above tables with all necessary **keys, relationships, constraints, and navigations**. These models should exist in `**RestaurantReservation.Db**`
6. Write migrations to create the previous tables. Migrations should exist in `**RestaurantReservation.Db**`.
7. Seed the tables with at least **5 records** in each.
8. In the `**RestaurantReservation`** console application, demonstrate the functionality of all the methods you will create by calling them with sample data for testing purposes.
9. Write `**Create/Update/Delete**` methods for each entity.
10. Write methods to:
    1. `**ListManagers()**`: This method retrieves all employees who hold the position of "Manager."
    2. `**GetReservationsByCustomer(CustomerId)**`: This method takes a customer identifier as a parameter and returns a list of reservations made by that particular customer.
    3. `**ListOrdersAndMenuItems(ReservationId)**`: This method takes a reservation identifier as a parameter and lists the orders placed on that specific reservation along with the associated menu items.
    4. `**ListOrderedMenuItems(ReservationId)**`: This method takes a reservation identifier as a parameter and finds the menu items ordered in that specific reservation.
    5. `**CalculateAverageOrderAmount(EmployeeId)**`: This method takes an employee identifier as a parameter and calculates the average order amount for that specific employee.
11. Views:
    1. Use EF Core to query a database view that lists all the reservations with their associated customer and restaurant information.
    2. Generate a query that retrieves employees with their respective restaurant details from a database view.
12. Database Functions:
    1. Create a database function to `**Calculate the total revenue generated by a specific restaurant`** using Entity Framework Core migrations.
    2. Implement the function call in your `**RestaurantReservation.Db**` project, making it accessible from your application.
13. Stored Procedures:
    1. Design a stored procedure for **`Finding all customers who have made reservations with a party size greater than a certain value`** using Entity Framework Core migrations.
    2. Develop a method in your RestaurantReservation.Db project to execute the stored procedure.
14. Create a repository class for each entity and call it: `**{EntityName}Repository.cs**`, and move related methods from the previous requirements to the right repository. These repositories should exist in `**Repositories**` folder `**RestaurantReservation.Db**`
